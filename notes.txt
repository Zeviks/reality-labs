[ Installation ] 
Next.JS 13, TailwindCSS, Sanity v3

[ Installing Sanity v3 ]
npm create sanity@latest -- --coupon sonny2022

This asks you multiple questions upon installing, 
Project name, 
our programming l
etc, 

They also have predefined schemas that we can use, for example in this case i picked the blog schema for the blog side of things of the app 

Now allow sanity to work with next js, we need to then install the sanity-next plugin. This allows sanity to connect to our next.js frontend.


When you use the sanity command, it will create its own project, with its own package.json and node_modules. Since we already have does what it did 
is go into the sanity package.json, and copied over all of the necessary dependencies for sanity to function, then i move of all the required files for sanity 
Like the scheams folder, sanity.cli and sanity.config.

In general i took two separete projects and merged them to gether.
