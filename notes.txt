[ Installation ] 
Next.JS 13, TailwindCSS, Sanity v3

[ Installing Sanity v3 ]
npm create sanity@latest -- --coupon sonny2022

This asks you multiple questions upon installing, 
Project name, 
our programming l
etc, 

They also have predefined schemas that we can use, for example in this case i picked the blog schema for the blog side of things of the app 

Now allow sanity to work with next js, we need to then install the sanity-next plugin. This allows sanity to connect to our next.js frontend.
